# iFogSim Simulator

## History

## Installation steps (Date: Dec 3, 2022)
1. Download and install Eclipse IDE for Java
2. Follows instructions given in iFogSim to create Java project and import jars inot classpath
3. Add 
    ```
    {
        requires java.desktop;
    }
    ```
    to src/module-info.java

4. If you have multiple errors, then try to change the JRE versions back and forth and then finally assign back to the initial one. I have no idea why this resolved the issues.

## Sample example run

Execute one of the java sources in perfeval package in src folder
